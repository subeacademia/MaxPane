# Changelog

All notable changes to ReDockIT will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- **Pane menu button (▼)** — 16 px button at the right edge of every tab bar. Left-click opens the pane context menu (same as right-click). Hit-test returns `-2`; hover highlights the button.
- `CalcTabBarLayout` shared helper — single source of truth for tab geometry used by `DrawTabBar`, `TabHitTest`, and `IsOnTabCloseButton`.
- `GetTabRect` helper — returns the screen rect for a given tab index; used for targeted invalidation on color change.
- `ExpandRect` static helper (both `container.cpp` and `container_input.cpp`) — in-place RECT union, skips empty src/dst to prevent dirty-rect corruption.

### Changed
- **Targeted `InvalidateRect`** — hover/drag operations now invalidate only the affected rect instead of the full window:
  - Splitter hover: union of old + new splitter rect
  - Tab/menu-button hover: union of old + new item rect via `GetTabRect` / inline button rect
  - Drag highlight change: union of old + new highlight pane rect
  - Drag cancel/end: source tab bar + old highlight pane rect
  - Tab color change: only that tab's rect via `GetTabRect`
  - Timer hover timeout: cached old hover rects only
- Tab area now reserves `PANE_MENU_BTN_WIDTH` (16 px) on the right for the menu button; tabs shrink accordingly.

### Fixed
- **`TabHitTest` x-bounds regression** — the menu-button check (`x >= paneRect.right - 16`) was firing for clicks *outside* the pane's x range (e.g. in the adjacent right-side pane), causing the pane context menu to appear instead of tab interactions. Fix: check `x < paneRect.left || x >= paneRect.right` before the menu-button test.
- `ExpandRect` now guards against empty `src` rect (`{0,0,0,0}`) in both call-sites, preventing the dirty rect from expanding into origin unnecessarily.

### Removed
- Scroll arrows (`<` / `>`) for tab overflow — tabs shrink when a pane is narrow (original behaviour). `m_tabScrollOffset`, `TAB_SCROLL_ARROW_WIDTH`, `TAB_OVERFLOW_THRESHOLD` removed.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- Splitter hover highlights (white bar on mouseover)
- Tab hover highlights (lighten effect on mouseover)
- Per-project state persistence via RPP files (`project_config_extension_t`)
- `StateAccessor` abstraction for polymorphic state I/O (global, project, RPP)

### Fixed
- Workspace switch rendering: blank/artifact windows (e.g. Routing Matrix) after switching back
- Frameless floating windows when closing tabs via [x]
- Windows reappearing floating after REAPER restart despite being closed
- Shutdown lifecycle: proper toggle state check, reparent-before-toggle sequence
- Quit interception via hookcommand for reliable state save on macOS/Windows
- RepositionAll repaint: `SWP_FRAMECHANGED` + `InvalidateRect` after pane resize

### Changed
- Simplified to global docker model (removed per-project visibility switching)
- RPP state I/O now uses synchronous `project_config_extension_t` (replaced deferred timer)
- `LoadWorkspace` uses `ReleaseAll(false)` for smoother workspace transitions
- `DoCapture` forces frame recalculation via `SWP_FRAMECHANGED`

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **Startup deadlock**: REAPER could hang when loading a project with ReDockIT docked. The capture queue now defers `Main_OnCommand` calls during `LoadState()` to avoid calling REAPER APIs while the project is still loading.

### Changed
- Replaced raw `new`/`delete` with `std::unique_ptr` for safer resource management
- Replaced all `strncpy` calls with `safe_strncpy` helper for consistent null-termination
- Extracted magic numbers (colors, geometry, timing) into named constants in `config.h`
- Merged duplicate `FindWindowEnumProc`/`FindChildWindowEnumProc` into single function
- Debug logging is now conditional on `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` (no longer always enabled)
- Added `-Wshadow` and `-Wconversion` compiler warnings

### Removed
- Dead code: unused `BuildLists()` and `IsAnyCaptured()` methods

## [1.0.0] - 2025-03-01

### Added
- Native C++ REAPER extension (no script dependencies)
- Binary split tree layout engine with up to 16 panes
- Tabbed window management with drag-and-drop between panes
- 14 known REAPER windows with one-click capture
- Arbitrary window capture (including ReaImGui scripts)
- Dock frame detection for ReaImGui windows
- Async capture queue with retry logic
- Named workspaces (save/restore complete layouts)
- Favorites system with persistent action command strings
- Tab color palette (8 colors)
- 5 built-in layout presets
- Auto-open on REAPER startup (configurable)
- Full state persistence via REAPER ExtState
- Dockable container (integrates with REAPER's docker system)
- Context menus for panes and tabs
- Capture-by-click mode
- Conditional debug logging (Debug builds only)
- Cross-platform architecture via WDL/SWELL
